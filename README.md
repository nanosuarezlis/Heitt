# Testing React js

If you now run npm run start you should see localhost:8080 open up in your default browser — that’s what the —-open flag is for. Now everytime you make changes, it will refresh the page.

You can also add a --hot flag to your npm start script which will allow you to only reload the component that you’ve changed instead of doing a full page reload. This is Hot Module Replacement.
